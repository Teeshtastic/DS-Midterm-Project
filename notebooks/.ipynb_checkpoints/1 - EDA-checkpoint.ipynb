In the file functions_variables.py, there is an example function that you can import and use.  If you have any variables, functions or classes that you want to make, they can be put in the functions_variables.py file and imported into a notebook.  Note that only .py files can be imported into a notebook. If you want to import everything from a .py file, you can use the following:\n",

    "If you just import functions_variables, then each object from the file will need to be prepended with \"functions_variables\"\\\n",
